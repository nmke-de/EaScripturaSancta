# Ea Scriptura Sancta

**Ea Scriptura Sancta** is an online bible written without any JavaScript.

## But why?

Spread God's word and do it without spying on people! Also, a [previous version](https://old.nmke.de/ESS.cdo) did not respond well to Non-ASCII characters.

### What about the name?

It's Latin for "The Holy Scripture".

## Dependencies

- [PHP](https://php.net) and web server stuff that usually accompanies PHP.
- POSIX shell

## Deployment

After setting up a web server with PHP-CGI (or FastCGI or whatever), copy the files of this repository, retaining the directory structure. This can also be done by typing `git clone https://github.com/nmke-de/EaScripturaSancta`.

More bibles can be added by placing the corresponding tsv-files in the `bib/` folder.

## Usage

Open the website. Is that too much to ask for?

## Demo

Coming soon.
